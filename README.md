# List decoder for Arikan PAC codes

C++ programs for Polarlization-Adjusted-Convolutional(PAC) codes presented by Arikan[1] and its list decoder[2].  
The part of my codes related to polar list decoder are based on the [programs](https://github.com/tavildar/Polar) by Saurabh Tavildar.  
To compile the code, use the following command:  
`g++ -static -o (name of executable file) main.cpp PACcode.cpp`
